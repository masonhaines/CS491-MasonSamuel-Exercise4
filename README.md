# Setup Instructions

## Install Node.js Dependencies

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm init -y
npm install express
npm install cors
```

This installs Express and creates the `package.json` file.  
Note: `npm i express` and `npm install express` do the same thing â€” you only need one.

## Running the Code in Codespaces

- Open the terminal (`Ctrl + \``)
- Start the server with:
  ```
  node server.js
  ```
- Set the port visibility to **public** (option is to the right of the terminal tab)
- Codespaces will prompt you to open a new browser tab for the server
- Compare the active server URL to the fetch URL in your code:
  - If anything before `/token` doesn't match, update it and run the project locally unless Sam or Mason are available to push updated url
- Use the active link below and enter your username when prompted
